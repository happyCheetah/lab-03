## Lab Question Answers
Question 1:
REST APIs are highly scalable due to the stateless nature of their client-server architecture, meaning that servers do not store information about clientÕs previous information, thus reducing computing overhead. Additionally, statelessness allows server to handle a large number of concurrent requests. 

Question 2:
The term resources in the context of REST APIs refer to that various applications can provide to specific clients. These include, but are not limited to, text, images, video, numbers or any type of data. 

Question 3:
The method not used by our server is the put method. 

Question 4:
API keys are used as a means for clientÕs to authorize themselves in order to access server data. API keys are crucial because they prevent unauthorized usage of server information/commands.
